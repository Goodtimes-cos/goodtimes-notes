Here in my shrine,\
That you have forgotten,\ 
Here do you toil,\
That you might remember,\
Here you reclaim,\
What faithless minds have stolen,\
Far from yourself,\
I grow nearer to you,\
Your eyes once were blinded,\
Now through me do you see,\
Your hands once were idle,\
Now through them do I speak,\
And when the world shall listen,\
And when the world shall see,\
And when the world remembers,\
That world shall cease to be.

Sugar is my enemy, I can't focus at all when I consume it. :3
