# Goodtimes Exocore
## What is exocore?
The [exocore](https://exocore.netlify.app/) is developed by [Remilia Corporation](https://remilia.org) as a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) worfklow and extension of [Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) to complete the system of an accessible and standardized autopublishing knowledgebase network, as a proof-of-concept for [Remilia's New Internet](https://mirror.xyz/charlemagnefang.eth/831rVsd2Z7cjxnBAw118gW8MylKibfC2AeJ6YUHiAvA).

## What is my instance about?
This will be where I make notes and keep track of my thoughts. I also plan to adopt a Poetic worldview overtime, and this seems to be a great medium for this change to be expressed.

I am primarily interested in languages, culture and philosophy, 
though I also have the fortune to be a Maths and Computer Science major. By documenting my learning, I hope to deepen my understanding in these broad areas of study.

With regards to unhealthy habits, I enjoy wasting time on YouTube and watching anime.
