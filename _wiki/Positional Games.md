# Positional Games
- What is a positional game, with regards to $X$ and $F$?
- What are the differences between a *strong game*, *maker-breaker game* and *breaker-maker game*?
- What the the *Ramsey Game* $RG(n,t)$? What is $X$ and $F$?
- What is a strategy?
- What is a winning strategy?
-  Prove that if $S$ is a win for Breaker in the maker-breaker game $(X,F)$, then it's also a draw for Player 2 in the strong game $(X,F)$. (Hint: This one is simply logical)
- What does Zermelo 1913. state?
- Prove that for any finite set $X$ and family $F$ of subsets of $X$, there is no winning strategy for Player 2 in the strong game $(X,F)$. (Hint: We devise an alternative strategy $S'$ based on player 2's winning strategy $S$. What is this kind of strategy called?)
- Proposition 2.7. states that if maker wins a breaker-maker game, he must also win the maker-breaker game.
- Corollary 2.8. is Zermelo, but a stronger case, where player 2 cannot win, with respect to a strong game.
- Let $X$ be a finite set, and let $F$ be a family of subsets of $X$. Prove that if every red/blue-colouring of $X$ yields a monochromatic $A \in F$, then player 1 has a winning strategy in the strong game. Furthermore, Maker has a winning strategy in the maker-breaker game $(X, F)$. (Hint: Assume for a contradiction that Player 1 doesn't have a winning strategy for $(X, F)$.)
- Fact: Let $R_G(t)$ denote the smallest $n$ such that Player 1 has a winning strategy for RG$(n,t$. Proposition 2.9 implies that $R_G(t) \leq R(t,t)$.
- State the Erdős-Selfridge Theorem.
- State the proof of the Erdős-Selfridge Theorem. (Hint: Potential function)
- How does the condition of the Erdős-Selfridge Theorem relax if we apply it to a breaker-maker game?
- Fact: For the Ramsey game RG$(n,t)$, there are ${n \choose t}$ winning sets, each of size ${t \choose 2}$. It follows that if ${n \choose t} < 2^{{t \choose 2}-1}$, then Player 2 has a drawing strategy, so $R_G(t) > n$.
- What is a pairing strategy?
- How do we play in parallel?
- Prove that the unrestricted-$n$-in-a-row maker-breaker game is Breaker's win for every $n \geq 40$.
- What is a multigraph?
- What is a connectivity game on a multigraph $G$?
- Prove that if Maker wins the connectivity game on a multigraph $G$, then $G$ has two edge-disjoint spanning trees.
- Prove that if a multigraph $G$ has two edge-disjoint spanning trees, then Maker wins the connectivity game on $G$.
