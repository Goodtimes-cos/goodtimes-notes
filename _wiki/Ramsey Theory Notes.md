# Ramsey Theory Notes
- What is the pigeonhole principle with regards to ramsey theory?
- How do you prove the above?
- What is the definition of a Ramsey number?
- Prove that $R(3,3) = 6$.
- Prove the following:
	- $R(1, t) = 1$,
	- $R(s,t) = t$,
	- $\exists R(s,t) \rightarrow R(s,t) = R(t,s)$. 
- Prove that $R(s,t)$ exists, and that for $s,t \geq 2, R(s,t) \leq R(s-1,t) + R(s,t-1)$.
