# Extremal Set Theory
- What is a partially ordered set $(P, \leq)$?
- When are two elements $x, y$ comparable?
- When is a poset a total ordering?
- When do we say that $x \in P$ is a maximal element of $P$?
- Prove that every finite poset has a maximal element. (Hint: Consider the sequence of the elements of the poset. Suppose an arbitrary element is not maximal. What happens?)
- When is a subset $C \subseteq P$  a chain?
- When is a subset $A \subseteq P$ an antichain?
- If a poset $(P, \leq)$ can be partitioned in $r$ chains, then the largest antichain has size at more $r$, since it meets every chain in at most one element. Similary, if $P$ can be partitioned into $r$ antichains, then the largest chain has size at most $r$.
- Prove that if the largest chain in P has size $r$, then P can be partitioned into $r$ antichains. (Mirsky)
- Let $P$ be a finite poset. Prove that if the largest antichain in P has size $r$, then P can be partitioned into $r$ chains. (Dilworth)
- Prove that $A = {a_1, \dots, a_r}$ is an antichain.
- What is a bipartite graph?
- Prove that for a bipartite graph with vertex classes $A$ and $B$ such that $|N(S)| \geq |S|$ for all $S \subseteq A$. Then, $G$ contains a matching covering all of $A$.
- Prove Sperner's lemma.
- Prove the YBLM inequality.
- Prove the Littlewood-Offord problem.
